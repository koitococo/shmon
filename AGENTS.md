# Coding Standards for Agents

## Preface

This skill defines a common set of standard rules for coding agents ("agents" for short) to follow. **Bad things will happen if agents don't obey these rules.**

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this skill are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 1. General Rules

1. Agents MUST comply with users' requirements. They MUST NOT perform any steps, operations, or actions beyond the scope of those requirements.
2. Agents MUST NOT guess or assume anything that is not explicitly present in the context. When available, agents SHOULD use tools to ask users clarifying questions.

## 2. Tool Utilization Rules

1. Agents MUST make full use of all tools provided to them.
2. When MCP tools are available, agents SHOULD prioritize them over other tools.
   - For example, if `mcp__filesystem__list_directory` tool is available, agents should use it to read a directory instead of executing `ls` command.
3. `bash` tool or any other tools that execute a command SHOULD be used only if the required feature does not exist in any other tools OR if all other tools fail to accomplish the goal.
   - For example, if there are `edit` tool available, `bash` tool with `cat` command should not be used.

## 3. Code Editing Rules

1. Agents SHOULD NOT edit any files or directories related to coding standards, including but not limited to linter configuration files, formatter configuration files, and any other files that are used to configure the coding environment. If an edit is absolutely required, Agents MUST ask users for confirmation.
2. Agents MUST NOT edit any files or directories that are not part of the project. The only exception is that Agents MAY edit files or directories inside `/tmp`, `%TEMP%`, or any other temporary directories specified by users.

## 4. Code Analysis Rules

1. Agents SHOULD frequently check LSP (Language Server Protocol) messages (if available), linting outputs and type checking results. An execution of linter or type checking tool SHOULD be triggered after any complete edit action to the code.
2. Agents SHOULD do everything possible to fix any errors or warnings by reviewing the code in detail and editing them. If it is not possible, Agents MUST stop any current tasks and ask users for help.
3. Agents MUST NOT try to bypass any errors or warnings raised by compilers, linters or static code analyzers. Forbidden methods include but not limited to:
   - Disabling or suppressing compiler warnings or linter rules by inserting disabling comments or editing configuration files.
   - Using compiler flags that disable type checking or other features that are intended to catch errors.
   - Evading typing enforcement by using type casting (for example, `as unknown as` in TypeScript) or other methods that bypass type checking.
   - Downgrading, replacing or modifying third-party dependencies that are required for the project to compile or run, without explicit permission from users.
   - Any other methods that are intended to bypass enforcements of coding standards.

## 5. Documentation Fetching Rules

1. Agents SHOULD fetch the latest documentation of tools, libraries, and frameworks used in the project by calling any tool possible to do so. For example, `bash` with `man` command for Unix commands, or `context7` MCP tool or `fetch` tool if they are provided.
   - Exception: Common knowledge or well-known tools are allowed to be used without fetching documentation.
2. If no tool is available, Agents MUST NOT fetch documentation by themselves using raw HTTP requests. For example, agents must not use `curl` command to fetch websites.
3. Agents MUST NOT continue any tasks, edit any code or execute any commands if they fail to comprehend the usage of any tools or libraries used in the project due to a lack of documentation and knowledge.

## 6. Unit Testing Rules

1. Agents SHOULD write unit tests for all code that is not trivial or obvious.
   - Exception: Agents MAY choose not to write unit tests if there are no unit test frameworks available or if the project does not require unit testing.
2. Unit tests SHOULD be written in a way that is easy to read and understand.
3. Unit tests SHOULD cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
4. Agents MUST NOT write unit tests that cheat on the coverage of the code. Examples include but not limited to:
   - Writing tests that only execute code without asserting behavior
   - Adding meaningless tests that pass trivially (assert True)
   - Testing trivial code while avoiding complex logic
   - Creating tests for code that's never used in production

## 7. shmon (Shell Monitor) Project Standards

### A. Project Overview
`shmon` is a minimal C/S terminal multiplexer. A dedicated daemon process is spawned per session to host a PTY and manage a shell. Clients connect via Unix Domain Sockets to attach/detach from these sessions.

### B. Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: `tokio` (multi-thread for daemon, current-thread for client).
- **Communication**: `tokio-util` with `PacketCodec` (Length-prefix framing).
- **System**: `nix` and `libc` for PTY, Fork, and Signals.
- **Paths**: `dirs` for `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rshpool` socket storage.

### C. Core Architecture & Rules
1. **Daemon Spawning (Double-Fork)**: Must occur in `src/server/mod.rs` **before** any Tokio runtime is initialized. `Grandparent -> fork -> Intermediate (setsid) -> fork -> Daemon`.
2. **PTY Initialization**: The `Daemon` calls `pty::spawn_pty_shell` which performs a **third fork** to exec the shell.
3. **Runtime Start**: Only the final `Daemon` process initializes `tokio::runtime`.
4. **Communication Protocol (`src/protocol.rs`)**: `[1-byte Type][4-byte Length][Payload]`. Types: `0: Data`, `1: Resize`, `2: Signal`. Use `bytes::Bytes` for zero-copy. MAX_PAYLOAD = 1MB.
5. **Server Logic (`src/server/daemon.rs`)**: Bind sockets with `0o600`. PTY reader runs as independent task. Main loop handles accept + commands. MAX_CLIENTS = 8. Graceful shutdown via JoinSet::abort_all().
6. **Backlog**: Fixed-size (`64KB`) `VecDeque<Bytes>` history in `src/server/backlog.rs`.
7. **Client Logic (`src/client/attach.rs`)**: Use `RawModeGuard` (RAII) for terminal state. Multiplex stdin/stdout and SIGWINCH resize events.
8. **Logging**: Use `tracing` crate (info!/warn!/error!/debug!). Daemon stdout is redirected to log file.

### D. Safety Constraints
- **Unsafe Code**: Every `unsafe` block MUST have a comment explaining why it is safe and necessary.
- **FD Management**: Explicitly close slave FDs in parent and master FDs in child during PTY setup.
- **Cleanup**: Daemon MUST remove `.sock` and `.pid` files on exit.

### E. Project Status (Updated: 2026-03-31, Post-Refactor)

#### Implemented Components
1. **Double-Fork Daemon (`src/server/mod.rs`)**: Complete with session isolation via `setsid()`.
2. **PTY Spawn (`src/server/pty.rs`)**: Fork + exec shell with master/slave FD management.
3. **Communication Protocol (`src/protocol.rs`)**: Length-prefixed framing with MAX_PAYLOAD (1MB) protection. 5 encode/decode tests.
4. **Client Attach (`src/client/attach.rs`)**: Raw mode guard, SIGWINCH handling, bidirectional IO multiplexing.
5. **Utils (`src/utils.rs`)**: Runtime directory resolution (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR → cache_dir → /tmp fallback).
6. **Backlog (`src/server/backlog.rs`)**: 64KB circular buffer with 6 comprehensive tests.
7. **Daemon (`src/server/daemon.rs`)**: Multi-task architecture — independent PTY reader task, JoinSet client management (MAX_CLIENTS=8), graceful shutdown.

#### Architecture (Post-Refactor)
- **PTY Reader**: Independent tokio task, sends data via broadcast channel (resolves select! starvation)
- **Client Management**: JoinSet with MAX_CLIENTS=8 limit
- **Shutdown**: Graceful via JoinSet::abort_all() + 100ms cleanup delay
- **Logging**: `tracing` crate with `env-filter` (RUST_LOG env var)
- **Protocol**: 1MB payload limit, comprehensive encode/decode tests
- **Broadcast**: Handles RecvError::Lagged gracefully (skip + warn)

#### Current State
- **Compilation**: `cargo check` passes, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean
- **Tests**: 11 unit tests (5 protocol + 6 backlog)
- **Dependencies**: tokio, tokio-util, bytes, nix, libc, clap, dirs, anyhow, futures, tracing, tracing-subscriber
- **Build**: `cargo build --release` succeeds

## Closing Words

Coding agents exist to help developers to write code faster and more efficiently. They are not meant to replace developers, but to assist them in their tasks. Therefore, standards must be followed to ensure that the code is of high quality and maintainable.
